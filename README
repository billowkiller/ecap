This Software is a collection of simple eCAP adapters.
The adapters illustrate eCAP usage but are not be suitable for production use.

Available adapters (installed in /usr/local/lib/ by default):

    minimal: refuses to adapt any message without looking at the message body
             uses "minimal" implementation we could come up with
             installed as ecap_adapter_minimal.*

    passthru: refuses to adapt any message but receives and echoes back
              the entire message body, if any
              installed as ecap_adapter_passthru.*

    modifying: modifiers headers and, if possible, the body of any message
               illustrates header and body manipulation and body accumulation
               installed as ecap_adapter_modifying.*

The libecap library is required to build and use these adapters. You can get
the library from http://www.e-cap.org/. The adapters can be built and
installed from source, usually by running:

    % ./configure
    % make
    % make install

information, please visit the eCAP project web site: http://www.e-cap.org/
