v0.2.0
2011/02/20

	Support libecap v0.2.0:

	- Changed Service::re/configure() profile to use
	  libecap::Options.

	- Added empty Xaction::option() and Xaction::visitEachOption()
	  methods.

	Require libecap v0.2 at ./configure time. This prevents
	accidentally building adapters with the wrong libecap version.

	Use pkg-config for building with libecap.

	Specify libecap link options in *_LDFLAGS (instead of *_LIBADD)
	because automake documentation seems to recommend that.


v0.1.0
2011/01/10

	General:

	- Use libecap::Config type name to become compatible with
	  libecap v0.1.0.

	- Polished code formatting.


	Modifying Adapter:

	- Use libecap::Config::visitEach() method to configure the
	  adapter using host-provided victim and replacement values.
	  Illustrate basic configuration validation technique.
	
	- Allow victim string to be a part of the replacement string by
	  not searching the replaced string for the next victim start.


v0.0.3
2010/12/05

	- Fixed lp bug #320530: Chunks don't get concatenated correctly.

	- Fixed lp bug #338137: Sample adapters may prevent host from
	  retrieving entire adapted body.

	- Fixed lp bug #362069: Properly set receivingVb when
	  Adapter::Xaction::noteVbContentDone is called. The bug has no known
	  effect on sample adapters but may be affecting the real adapters
	  based on the sample ones.

	- Do not call vbDiscard to stop virgin body production in Modifying
	  Adapter. Call vbStopMaking instead.  vbDiscard is for informing the
	  host that the adapter will never access the virgin body.


v0.0.2
2008/09/30

	- First public release.
